## Fetal Head Circumference Prediction using U-Net

This project is focused on **segmenting fetal head regions** from ultrasound images using the **U-Net architecture**. The goal is to accurately measure fetal head circumference, a crucial indicator in **prenatal care and fetal development assessment**. Below is a step-by-step interpretation of the code implementation.

## 🚀 Required Libraries

The script starts by importing essential Python libraries such as:
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data handling.
- **OpenCV & PIL** for image processing.
- **Matplotlib** for visualization.
- **TensorFlow & Keras** for building and training the U-Net model.

Additionally, it sets up Kaggle access to **download the dataset** from an online repository.

## 📂 Dataset Preparation

### 1️⃣ Downloading and Organizing Data
- The dataset is fetched from Kaggle and extracted into appropriate directories.
- Images and masks are loaded using **Pathlib** and stored in a Pandas DataFrame for easy access.
- The dataset contains:
  - **`ImagePath`**: Paths to ultrasound images.
  - **`MaskPath`**: Paths to corresponding segmentation masks.

### 2️⃣ Image Preprocessing
- Images are resized to **256x256 pixels** for uniformity.
- They are converted into **NumPy arrays** for processing.
- **Normalization** is performed by scaling pixel values to the range `[0,1]`.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The initial dataset is displayed to verify correct loading. **Histograms** and **basic statistics** can be used to understand the pixel intensity distribution of images and masks.

## 🏗️ U-Net Implementation

### Why U-Net?
U-Net is a specialized **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed for **biomedical image segmentation**. It is used because of:
- **Efficient feature extraction** using an **encoder-decoder structure**.
- **Preserving spatial information** through **skip connections**.
- **Robust segmentation performance** with limited data.

### 1️⃣ Convolutional Block
- The `conv2d_block` function applies **two convolutional layers** with **Batch Normalization** and **ReLU activation**.
- This ensures **efficient feature extraction** while stabilizing training.

### 2️⃣ U-Net Architecture
The `get_unet` function constructs the full U-Net model with:
- **Encoder Path**: Captures high-level features using **convolutional layers** and **max pooling**.
- **Bottleneck (Latent Space)**: The deepest layer with **maximum feature extraction**.
- **Decoder Path**: Upsamples the feature maps using **transposed convolutions** and concatenates them with encoder layers via **skip connections**.
- **Final Output Layer**: Uses a `sigmoid` activation function to generate **binary segmentation masks**.

---

## ⚙️ Model Compilation
- The U-Net model is compiled using **Adam optimizer**.
- The loss function is **binary cross-entropy**, suitable for segmentation tasks.
- **Accuracy** is used as the evaluation metric.
